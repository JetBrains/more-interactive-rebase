> **The purpose of this document is to set clear expectations for the behavior of everyone 
> involved in this project. Please abide by this rules so that we ensure a welcoming 
> environment for everyone.**

## Standards
We value appropriate behavior that contributes to a better working environment:

- Using welcoming language
- Being respectful respectful
- Accepting constructive criticism

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Foul language
- Discrimination of any kind
- Derisive comments that aim to undermine
- Public or private harassment 
- Sharing private information 
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Shared team values

As a team we selected three main values that we will encourage and uphold
throughout the duration of the project to ensure a safe space for all team
members.
- **Respect**: We emphasize treating each team member with respect and
hearing everyone’s opinion during discussions.
- **Communication**: We value creating an open space where each team member can easily communicate their thoughts and concerns.
- **Honesty**: We believe that each team member should work with honesty
and integrity, both in terms of their communication with other team member.

## Communication
During the duration of our project the communication of the original team members will be through Slack. For every
additional contributor, they should use gitLab issues or contact us through our emails listed in the 
[README](README.md).

## Documents
All documents that are publicly accessible such as Contribution guide, are in the project repo.

## Planning
 We are using sprints. If a team member’s progress is delayed, the
reason will be discussed as a team in a meeting and the needed measures to
get back on track will be taken, whether that is getting another member to
help that person out or providing the needed resources.


## Commitment
The quality of the team member’s individual work is determined by how
closely they align with the sub-tasks given in the description of the issue they
are assigned to. Their work should also adhere to the standards in terms of the code coverage and follow our code
style rules mentioned in the [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). We deem a chair committed if they succeed in getting the agenda
done before every meeting. We deem a minute-taker committed if they succeed
in reporting a summary of ideas discussed for every agenda point.

## Norms and Evaluation Criteria

To evaluate our own work throughout the development process, we will follow
these 5 norms:
1. Keeps deadlines.
2. Implemented work adheres to its definition of done in the issue.
3. Improves work promptly according to feedback.
4. Provides actually insightful feedback on others’ work.
5. Actively participates in meetings.
